# CortexAgent Framework Architecture

## Overall Architecture

The CortexAgent Framework follows a perception-cognition-action pattern, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence systems.

### Main Components

1. **Perception** (Sensor(s)): Receives input from the environment
2. **Brain**: Processes information through two key cognitive functions:
   - **Reasoning**: Analyzes and interprets sensory data
   - **Planning**: Determines actions based on reasoning outcomes
3. **Action** (Activities/Skills): Executes decisions in the environment
4. **Memory**: Stores information that interacts bidirectionally with the brain

## Event-Driven Communication

The framework uses an event-driven architecture to manage the flow of information between components:

1. **Perception Events**: Triggered when input is processed
2. **Cognition Events**: Triggered during reasoning and planning
3. **Action Events**: Triggered when actions are executed
4. **Memory Events**: Triggered when memory is accessed or modified

This event-driven approach allows for flexible and extensible agent designs.
